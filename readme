```
or
```r
source("segment2.R")
```

## Code Structure

The codebase is organized into the following segments:

- `segment1.py` - [Brief description of what this segment does]
- `segment2.R` - [Brief description of what this segment does]
- [Add descriptions for additional segments as needed]

Each segment is self-contained and designed to be run independently. The output of each segment is designed to be easily readable and interpretable.
